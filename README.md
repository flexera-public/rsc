# rsc - An experimental generic RightScale API client

rsc provides both a command line tool and a go package for interacting with the RightScale APIs.
The currently supported APIs are the RightScale Cloud Management API 1.5 and 1.6 APIs as well as
the RightScale Self-Service 1.0 APIs (latest version for this product).

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rightscale/rsc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rightscale/rsc)
  ![Code Coverage](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rs-code-coverage/rsc/cc_badge_master.svg)

rsc can be used in one of two ways:

* As a command line tool, see [below](#usage) for usage.
* As a way to make API requests to RightScale programmatically from go code.

> *NOTE*: rsc is work in progress. The test coverage is currently very limited, use at your own risk.

Please use [github issues](https://github.com/rightscale/rsc/issues) to report problems.

## <a name="usage"></a>Command Line Tool

The command line tool uses subcommands to interact with each API. Use `rsc cm15` to send requests
to the RightScale Cloud Management API 1.5, `rsc cm16` to send requests to the RightScale Cloud
Management API 1.6 and `rsc ss` to send requests to the RightScale Self-Service API 1.0.

The general shape of a command line is:

```
$ rsc [GLOBAL] [API] ACTION HREF [PARAM=VALUE]
```
where `GLOBAL` is an optional list of global flags, `API` is `cm15`, `cm16` or `ss`, `ACTION` is
the API action to perform (i.e `index`, `show`, `update`, etc.), `HREF` is the resource or resource
collection href (i.e. `/api/servers`, `/api/servers/1` etc.) and `PARAM` and `VALUE` are the names
and values of the action parameters (e.g. `view=extended`).

The sections below cover each option in order.

### Global Flags

The list of global flags is:
```
  --help            Show help.
  --version         Show application version.
  -c, --config="/Users/raphael/.rsc"
                    path to rsc config file
  -a, --account=ACCOUNT
                    RightScale account ID
  -h, --host=HOST   RightScale login endpoint (e.g. 'us-3.rightscale.com')
  --email=EMAIL     Login email, use --email and --password or use --key or --rl10
  --pwd=PWD         Login password, use --email and --password or use --key or --rl10
  -k, --key=KEY     OAuth access token or API key, use --email and --password or use --key or --rl10
  --rl10            Proxy requests through RL 10 agent, use --email and --password or use --key or --rl10
  --hrefs           List all known href patterns for selected API or resource
  --x1=X1           Extract single value using JSON:select
  --xm=XM           Extract zero, one or more values using JSON:select and return space separated list
  --xj=XJ           Extract zero, one or more values using JSON:select and return JSON
  --xh=XH           Extract header with given name
  -n, --noRedirect  Do not follow redirect responses
  --fetch           Fetch resource with href present in 'Location' header
  --dump            Dump HTTP request and response for debugging
  --pp              Pretty print response body
```
A few key points:

`rsc` can read the API host, account and authentication information from a config file instead of the
command line. See [Setup and Config](#config) below.

Authentication can be done in one of three ways: 
* Using a RightScale user email and password (`--email` and `--password`)
* Using a OAuth token retrieved from the _API Credentials_ entry of the _Settings_ menu (`--key`)
* Using an API instance token to make API calls from a RightScale instance (`--key`)
* Using the RightLink 10 proxy to make API calls from a RightScale instance running RightLink 10 (`--rl10`)

The `--x1`, `--xm` and `--xj` flags make it possible to extract values from the response using a
JSON select expression (see [http://jsonselect.org/](http://jsonselect.org/)). For example:
```
$ rsc --xm .name cm15 index clouds
```
extracts the names of each cloud from the response and prints the result as a space separated list which
is convenient to consume from bash scripts for example.

### Actions and Parameters

The names of the action and its parameters follow the API documentation. Parameter names use form
encoding to represent nested data structures used in request bodies. For example with API 1.5 the command
line to create a volume is:
```
$ rsc --pp --fetch cm15 create clouds/1/volumes \
volume[name]="My New Volume" \
volume[size]="10" \
volume[datacenter_href]="/api/clouds/1/datacenters/5K443K2CF8NS6" \
volume[volume_type_href]="/api/clouds/1/volume_types/BDVEN383N1EN2"
```
(the `--pp` and `--fetch` options above are optional, `--fetch` makes a subsequent API call to retrieve
the newly created resource and `--pp` pretty prints the corresponding response).

The `/api/` prefix for CM API 1.5 and CM API 1.6 hrefs is optional so the following lists all deployments
in the account using the default view:
```
$ rsc cm16 index deployments
```
### <a name="config"></a>Command Line Tool Setup and Config
rsc has a top level `setup` command which creates a rsc config file. The config file contains the
RightScale account ID, API host, user email and (encrypted) password so that these flags don't have
to be provided each time the tool is invoked.

By default the config file is created in `$HOME/.rsc`, the location can be overridden using the
`--config` global flag. Multiple configs may be created to allow for different environments or
users. Use the `--config` flag when invoking the tool to specify the location of the config file if it's
not the default. The file itself is a simple JSON file that can be edited manually (apart from the
password value that needs to be encrypted by rsc).

### Built-in Help
The `--help` flag is available on all commands. It displays contextual help, for example:
```
$ rsc index --help
usage: rsc [<flags>] index <href> [<params>]

Lists all resources of given type in account.

Args:
  <href>      API Resource or resource collection href on which to act, e.g. '/api/servers'
  [<params>]  Action parameters in the form QUERY=VALUE, e.g. 'server[name]=server42'
```
Or:
```
$ rsc cm15 index clouds --help
usage: rsc [<flags>] index index /api/clouds [<cloud index params>]

Cloud index params:
filter[]=[]string
    <optional, [cloud_type|description|name]>

view=string
    <optional, [default|extended]>
```
The help lists the valid values for views and filters for example. It also indicates which flags are mandatory.

Another useful global flag is `--hrefs` which lists the valid Href pattern for the given resource or all
resources if no resource is specified. For example:
```
rsc --hrefs cm15 index clouds
Method Href Pattern    Resource.Action
GET    /api/clouds     Cloud.index
GET    /api/clouds/:id Cloud.show
```
Simply executing:
```
rsc --hrefs ss
```
lists all the actions supported by the Self-Service API and the corresponding href patterns.

## <a name="go"></a>Go Package

The other use case for rsc is making programmatic API requests to the RightScale platform. Each API client
code is encapsulated in a different sub-package: package `cm15` for CM API 1.5, package `cm16`for CM API
1.6 and package `ss` for Self-service APIs.

### Client Creation

Each API client package define a `Api` struct that represents the API client. Clients are created using one
of three factory methods: `New`, `NewRL10` or `FromCommandLine`. The later is used by the top level `main`
package to create clients from the values provided on the command line. `NewRL10` is meant to be called by
code that runs on a RightScale server running the RightLink 10 agent. It configures the client to talk to
the APIs through the proxy exposed by RightLink 10. Probably the most interesting function is `New` which
accepts an API host name, a RightScale account ID, authentication information and an optional logger and
low-level HTTP client. As an example the following creates a CM API 1.5 client that connects to 
`us-3.rightscale.com` using a OAuth refresh token for authentication, no logger and the default HTTP client:
```go
refreshToken := ... // Retrieve refresh token
auth := rsapi.OAuthAuthenticator{RefreshToken: refreshToken}
accountId := 123 // Retrieve account ID
client, err := cm15.New(accountId, "us-3.rightscale.com", &auth, nil, nil)
```

### Locators

Once a client has been created resources can be retrieved using resource locators. The code defines one
resource locator type per resource exposed by the underlying API.

Locators are instantiated using factory methods exposed by the client object. The factory methods
accept the collection or resource href and return the corresponding locator. For example the
following creates a cloud locator:
```go
var cloudLocator = client.CloudLocator("/api/clouds/1")
```
Locators expose one method for each action supported by the underlying collection or resource. For
example the clouds collection locator `CloudLocator` exposes an `Index()` and a `Show()` method.
Locator methods may return resources which are structs that expose the underlying resource 
attributes. For example the `CloudLocator` `Index()` method returns an array of `Cloud` resource.
A cloud resource is defined as:
```go
// Represents a Cloud (within the context of the account in the session).
type Cloud struct {
	Capabilities []string            `json:"capabilities,omitempty"`
	CloudType    string              `json:"cloud_type,omitempty"`
	Description  string              `json:"description,omitempty"`
	DisplayName  string              `json:"display_name,omitempty"`
	Links        []map[string]string `json:"links,omitempty"`
	Name         string              `json:"name,omitempty"`
}
```
and the `Index()` method is defined as:
```go
// GET /api/clouds
// Lists the clouds available to this account.
// -- Optional parameters:
// filter
// view
func (loc *CloudLocator) Index(options rsapi.ApiParams) ([]*Cloud, error)
```
The following code would invoke the `Index()` method using the default view and no filter to make the API request:
```go
var clouds, err = api.CloudLocator("/api/clouds").Index(rsapi.ApiParams{})
```
`Create` actions all return a locator so that fetching the corresponding resource is easy:
```go
var volumesLocator = client.VolumeLocator("/api/clouds/1/volumes")
var params cm15.VolumeParam{} // Code that sets parameters omitted for brevity
loc, err := volumeLocator.Create(&params)
if err == nil {
	volume, err := loc.Show(rsapi.ApiParams{})
	// ... check error, use volume etc.
}
```

### Using the Generic Methods

So far we've seen how you can interact with the APIs using strongly typed methods which are handy if you
need to make specific API calls from your code. However these methods don't work well if you need to write
a generic client that may need to make any arbitrary API call given a resource, an action and generic parameters.

For this use case each API client package also contains a generic `Do` method which accepts the name of
a resource, the name of an action, the href of the resource and a map of generic parameters (in the form of
`map[string]interface{}`):
```go
func (a *Api) Do(resource, action, href string, params rsapi.ApiParams) (*http.Response, error)
```
The `ss` package `Do` method additionally requires the name of the SS service to send requests to (i.e.
`designer`, `catalog` or `manager`). This is because there is not one RightScale Self-Service API but
three as noted in the [API reference](#reference) section above.

### Common code

The package `rsapi` contains common code for all client packages. It also defines a Api struct that each client
embed as an anonymous field and leverage for all common code. One such method that may be of use in your code
is `LoadResponse` that simply unmarshals the response body JSON and returns the result. If the response
contains a `Location` header (all `create` actions return one) then the function returns a map containing the
value of the location under the `"Location"` key. The signature of `LoadResponse` is:
```go
func (a *Api) LoadResponse(resp *http.Response) (interface{}, error)
```
The `rsapi` package also includes authenticators which sign API requests by adding the required auth headers 
(cookie in the case of email/password authentication, OAuth header in the case of OAuth and custom header in
the case of RightLink 10). Finally it contains common code used by all the clients to parse the command line.

### Building

To build `rsc` from source, first run `godep restore` to retrieve all its dependencies and once that's done
run `make`.
```
godep restore && make
```
### Code generation

Part of the `rsc` source code (the vast majority in terms of lines of code) is automatically 
generated from API metadata. There are currently two code generators: `api15gen` consumes the
RightScale CM API 1.5 metadata hosted [here](http://reference.rightscale.com/api1.5/api_data.json) and
`praxisgen` consumes the metadata for any [praxis](http://praxis-framework.io/) application (for example
for the RightScale CM API 1.6).

The code generator tools source code lives under the `gen` directory. Once the tools are compiled
and installed they can be invoked using `go generate`, see [http://blog.golang.org/generate](http://blog.golang.org/generate)
for information on how `go generate` works. The `go generate` comments live in the top level file
`generate.go`:
```go
//go:generate api15gen -metadata=cm15 -output=cm15
//go:generate praxisgen -metadata=cm16/api_docs -output=cm16 -pkg=cm16 -target=1.6 -client=Api
//go:generate praxisgen -metadata=ss/ssd/restful_doc -output=ss/ssd -pkg=ssd -target=1.0 -client=Api
//go:generate praxisgen -metadata=ss/ssc/restful_doc -output=ss/ssc -pkg=ssc -target=1.0 -client=Api
//go:generate praxisgen -metadata=ss/ssm/restful_doc -output=ss/ssm -pkg=ssm -target=1.0 -client=Api
```
When invoked the `api15gen` and `praxisgen` tools generate the `codegen_client.go` and `codegen_metadata.go`
for each API client in their directory.

The Makefile included in the source code contains a `rsc` target (the default target) that can be
invoked to generate the code and build the command line tool.

### Other Directories

The `ss` package consists of 3 sub-packages, one per self-service API: The `ssd` sub-package
contains the code for making requests to the RightScale Self-Service designer API, the `ssc` to the
RightScale Self-Service catalog API and finally `ssm` to the RightScale Self-Service manager API.
These are sub-packages instead of top-level packages so that they can be wrapped and exposed through
a single entry point (both for the command line and the go client methods).

The `metadata` directory defines the data types generated by `api15gen` and `praxisgen`. These
include data types that describe resources, actions and action parameters. These data structures
are used by the generated code and by the command line parsing code to provide contextual help
for example.

Finally, the `cmd` package contains common code used by `rsc` and each API command line processing
code to access command line flags.

#### Adding Support to a New RightScale API - or any Praxis application

To add support for a new API:
  1. Create a subdirectory whose name matches the name of the go package (`cm15`, `ss`, etc.).
  2. Put the JSON metadata describing the API in that directory (`api_docs` directory).
  3. Add a `go generate` directive that invokes the generator against the JSON to `generate.go`.
  4. Generate the code and add the corresponding command line parsing and `Do` methods (see
     `commands.go`, `http.go` and `cm16.go` in the cm16 directory for an example).
  5. Add the corresponding sub-command to rsc (see the top level `command_line.go` file).

The JSON metadata for praxis apps is the JSON generated by the `rake praxis:api_docs` command.
Updating a client to the latest version of an API thus consists of updating the corresponding JSON
and rebuilding the client (the `go generate` directives will take care of updating the generated
code).
